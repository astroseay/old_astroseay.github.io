intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a UI designer at Google.
    Before Google, I was a Ph.D. student in the 
    [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](http://hcii.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.
    My advisors were 
    [Anind Dey](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anind/) and 
    [Jodi Forlizzi](http://goodgestreet.com/). 
    I worked on designed and developed 
    [personal informatics tools](http://www.personalinformatics.org/) that help people better understand their own behavior.
    [My dissertation](http://ianli.com/thesis/) explored how contextual information can improve self-knowledge in personal informatics systems.
