intro:
  title: hey there,
  body: >
    I'm a Master's student in Astronomy at [Universiteit Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy). Before Leiden, I was a Bachelor student and later Junior Specialist at UC Santa Cruz in the [Astronomy department](http://astro.ucsc.edu/). I have lots of interests: with Prof. Jonathan Fortney I modeled the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters to better understand their measured spectra for exoplanet characterization. At Leiden, I've worked with Assistant Prof. Yamila Miguel on modeling the interiors of hot Jupiters for measuring bulk properties and to investigate the possibility of p and g-mode oscillations. I've also worked with Associate Prof. Matthew Kenworthy on finding planetary-mass companions around Sun-like stars in the Sco-Cen Association. Additional to research, I love project management and data analysis. My hobbies revolve around music and nature.
